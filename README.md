# c_graphing
a graphing tool designed in c


to plot a function, change the func_cal's definition at line 44 in the `graphing_array.c` file.

be sure to be nice to the function.
for example, 
if you want to plot log10(x), please multiply it by 10 so as to get appreciable results.
Thankyou!

p.s. this can be improved by returning a float value form `func_cal` and multiplying it by either 10 when <1 and 100 when <0.1 in the `func` function, but it is 1 AM at night and I am too tired to do it, if you wanna contribute, you are welcome to. Thankyou!
